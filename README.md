# Suicide Ideation Detection Using GRU, Logistic Regression, and Angular Frontend with Large Language Models Integration
https://suicideideationdetector.streamlit.app/

This project aims to detect suicide ideation from textual data using machine learning techniques and an interactive Angular-based frontend. Two modelsâ€”GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and Logistic Regressionâ€”were used for backend predictions. The project also integrates large language models (LLMs) like **Gemini** for advanced sentiment analysis and contextual understanding.

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for detecting suicide ideation from textual data, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and a responsive Angular frontend for user interaction. It also incorporates **Gemini**, a large language model, for enhancing sentiment and contextual analysis.

## Features

### Sentiment Analysis
- Analyzes text polarity using `TextBlob` and Gemini for advanced sentiment classification.
- Sentiment polarity values are categorized into `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative`.

### Personality-Like Features
- Includes text-level features such as text length, average word length, and number of words.
- Enhances models with additional contextual information for better predictions.

### Angular Frontend
- A responsive and user-friendly interface developed with **Angular**.
- Features:
  - **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can input text and receive predictions instantly.
  - **Sentiment Visualization**: Displays sentiment analysis and polarity scores.
  - **Model Comparison**: Compares predictions from GRU, Logistic Regression, and Gemini models.
  - **Interactive Charts**: Visualizes performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and loss over epochs.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: Text samples labeled as `suicide` or `non-suicide`.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Sentiment polarity values calculated using `TextBlob`.
  - Personality-like features such as text length and word counts.
  - Categorized sentiment polarity (`low`, `mid`, `high`) using thresholds.

---

## Preprocessing

1. **Text Cleaning**:
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing special characters
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Sentiment polarity scores
   - Personality features (text length, word count, etc.)
3. **Gemini Integration**:
   - Gemini provides context-aware embeddings for text analysis.

## Models Used

### Logistic Regression

- **Input**: TF-IDF features combined with sentiment and personality features.
- **Output**: Binary classification (`suicide` or `non-suicide`).
- **Performance**:
  - **Accuracy**: 94%
  - **Classification Report**: Detailed performance metrics for each class.

---

### GRU Model

- **Input**: Text embeddings, sentiment features, and personality features.
- **Architecture**:
  - Embedding Layer
  - GRU Layer
  - Fully Connected Layers
- **Performance**:
  - Before Adding Personality Features:
    - **Accuracy**: ~92%
  - After Adding Personality Features:
    - **Accuracy**: ~95%

---

### Gemini Integration

- **Purpose**: Enhances contextual understanding of the text.
- **Role**:
  - Analyzes text semantics.
  - Improves sentiment classification accuracy.
- **Output**: Context-aware sentiment scores used alongside GRU and Logistic Regression models.

---

## Frontend

### Angular Application

- Built with **Angular 16** for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- Key Features:
  - **Real-Time Input**: Accepts user text for classification.
  - **Visualization**: Displays predictions, sentiment scores, and personality metrics.
  - **Model Comparison**: Allows users to compare predictions across GRU, Logistic Regression, and Gemini.

### Backend Integration

- RESTful API developed in **Flask**.
- API endpoints:
  - `/predict`: Returns predictions from GRU and Logistic Regression.
  - `/analyze`: Provides sentiment and personality analysis for the input text.
  - `/gemini`: Integrates Geminiâ€™s predictions for advanced insights.

---

## Evaluation

### Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures overall performance.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Evaluates per-class performance.
- **Loss and Accuracy Curves**: Visualize training and validation progress over epochs.

### Visualizations

- **Frontend Charts**:
  - Real-time performance metrics displayed using Angular charts.
- **Training Visualizations**:
  - Loss and accuracy trends plotted for GRU fine-tuning.
